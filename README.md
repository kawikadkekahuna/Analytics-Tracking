###Business Objective
Good morning team! We just got a request from the new CMG(Chief Marketing Groovru) that he wants to start A/B testing every element across the entire site for user interaction. We are going to need you to create a script that can be included in an HTML page that tracks every click on a page and reports what element was clicked so that we know at a micro level how users are interacting with our new optimized, user-friendly, uber-engagement platform. 

###Your Task
Mock up a simple HTML page with a bunch of different elements on the page and create a script that tracks every single element clicked and the number of times it was clicked. We will worry about saving this to our analytics database later, we just need a way to prove that it works.

Thaaannnks :D
